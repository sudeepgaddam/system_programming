Makefile
Input.txt
Sample "wordCount.txt" for Input.txt file

How To Run:
     There is a Makefile provided.
     So, make will build 1 output files => Main.out
     You need to give following command:
	   ./Main.out <Input file path> <Num-Mapper threads> <Num-Reducer threads> > "outputfile"
	 Main.out expects three arguements , Input file name, Mapper threads, Reducer threads

	 Sample Execution:
		./Main.out "./Input.txt" 2 1
	 After running it, It writes word count to wordCount.txt in the same directory
	 make clean will remove all the *.out files
	 
Sample Output:
	(cap,4)
	(class,3)
	(concurrency,1)
	(course,4)
	(culture,2)
	(date,4)
	(door,4)
