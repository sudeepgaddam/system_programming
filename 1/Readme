Makefile
Input.txt
Sample "Output.txt" for Input.txt file

How To Run:
     There is a Makefile provided.
     So, make will build three output files => combiner.out, reducer.out and mapper.out
     You need to give following command:
	   ./combiner.out ./Input.txt > "outputfile"
	 combiner.out expects a single arguement. i.e., the input file path
	 After running it prints out the word counts for each word.
	 make clean will remove all the *.out files
	 
Sample Output:
	(cap,4)
	(class,3)
	(concurrency,1)
	(course,4)
	(culture,2)
	(date,4)
	(door,4)
	(eraser,5)
	(error,3)
	(field,5)
	(floor,1)
	(gap,4)
	(group,9)
