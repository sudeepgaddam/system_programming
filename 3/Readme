	   ./Main.out <Num philosophers> <Num-iterations>
	 Main.out expects two arguements, Number of philosphers and Number of Rounds

	 Sample Execution:
		./Main.out  5 2
	 After running it, It prints states of philosophers during execution of dining philosophers
	 problem. States are: Thinking, Hungry and eating. All the child processes of Main.out will exec philosopher.out.
	 Initially, Before the barrier condition pass, All philosophers are in Thinking state.
